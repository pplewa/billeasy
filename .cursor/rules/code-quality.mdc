# Code quality

- Never use hacks or code shortcuts, I despise them, you despise them
- Always attempt to remove all code TODOs
- IMPORTANT!!! Never compromise on workarounds and quick fixes, always do things properly even if it requires major refactor - you are not in a rush and have all the time in the world to do things right. 
- Everytime look for code duplicates and remove and refactor.
- Build the system in a way as it was mission critical system as everyone's life depends on it.
