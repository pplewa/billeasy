# Dependency rules

- Do not use under any circumstances Next Auth (next-auth) package this is critical!, use email based existing auth mechanism
- Always check for existing depencencies, versions and usages in [package.json](mdc:package.json) and reuse what is availble before installing something with similar functionality
- Before implementing something that wasn't specifically asked for check if it is okay to proceed
- in Next.js 15, the params and searchParams props are now Promises. 
- Current version of is "next-intl": "^3.26.5" that has different structure and API to older versions, please ensure any translations work is following current version
- Check the documentation that matches dependencies version
